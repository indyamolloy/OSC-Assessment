# EcoStore E-commerce Website
This project was built with React.js. The completed project can be viewed at https://store-project-one.vercel.app/

### Roadmap
 - [X] Items can be added to mini basket
 - [X] Mini basket can be viewed on all pages
 - [X] Basket items can be added/removed
 - [X] Loading icon while waiting for API data 
 - [ ] Fix search functionality
 - [ ] Make wishlist section 
 
*Given more time with this assessment, I would refactor code, implement tests for the API & functions, reorganise CSS (CSS modules) and make the website mobile responsive.
